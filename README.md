A heavily modified and optimized lightweight ReAPI fork of CSGOMod, originally developed by [TheDoctor0](https://github.com/TheDoctor0).

This fork has been simplified to remove all additional resources such as models, maps, and sounds, retaining functionality exclusively for the rank system, including sprites for rank badges (used for hovering). Originally developed for my own server, OLD SCHOOL CS (Xash3D engine), this version is now shared publicly following the serverâ€™s closure.
